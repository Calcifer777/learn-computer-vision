# Applications

## Detection and segmentation

### Semantic segmentation

- Given an input image, return a category for each pixel in the image.
- does not differentiate the number of instances
- Approach: fully convolutional layer with downsampling and upsampling

### Classification and localization

Search a single object in an image and produce a bounding box for it.

### Object detection

Search a varying number of objects in an image and produce a bounding box for each of them.

### Instance segmentation

- Given an input image, return a category for each pixel in the image.
- Like semantic segmentation, but differentiates the number of instances


## Texture synthesis

## Style transfer

Fast style transfer
